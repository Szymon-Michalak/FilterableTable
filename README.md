# Filterable Table Project

This project implements filterable and paginated data tables using Bootstrap and jQuery. The tables allow users to filter data based on specific criteria and navigate through pages of results.

## Features

- **Filterable Tables**: Users can filter data by selecting options from a dropdown menu.
- **Pagination**: The tables support pagination, allowing users to navigate through large datasets easily.
- **Dynamic Content**: The tables are populated dynamically with data, which can include links to additional resources.
